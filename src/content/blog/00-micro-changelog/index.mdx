## Pagefind search üîé

[Pagefind](https://pagefind.app) is a search library for static websites. Micro uses [Sergey Shishkin's](https://github.com/shishkin) [astro-pagefind](https://github.com/shishkin/astro-pagefind) integration. This integration simplifies development and does not require any changes to the default build script.

Press <kbd>/</kbd> or <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> to open the search dialog. For Mac users, <kbd>‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> can also be used. To dismiss the search dialog, press <kbd>Esc</kbd> or click on an area outside the component.

### Build and develop

<Callout type="error">
  The site **must** be built at least once so Pagefind can index the content.
</Callout>

```bash
# Pagefind must index the site to function
npm run build
```

When developing you can continue to use `npm run dev` and Pagefind will use the index from the last available build.

## DELETE EVERYTHING ABOVE ME

## Introduction

Well, I am gonna start off by saying that I will NOT be able to explain why I like this game in its entirety without this blog turning into a whole novel, so I'll (try to) keep it brief. Here's what I'm gonna classify this on: Story, Gameplay, and some other miscellaneous things.

## A Few Words Before Starting

First off, "What is _Yakuza_?", I hear you asking. The term _Yakuza_ refers to a Japanese gangster. Technically it's used to refer to the organized criminal organizations that are present there, think _Italian Mafia_ but replace Italian with Japanese, and Mafia with Yakuza, the _Japanese Yakuza_. Now that you know what that means, I'll start off with how I fell into this rabbit hole in the first place.

The thing is that getting into this game was a choice, a choice between Yakuza 0 and Assassin's Creed Odyssey. I picked this (thankfully) and boy am I glad that I did. When I saw the review videos of this game, I immediately got the impression that this was essentially Japanese GTA, a big misconception that many new players have, which gets washed away the more you play this game. You can't really fit Yakuza 0 into a genre, but the closest thing to describing it would be if GTA and the Godfather had a baby, a _Japanese_ baby.

_Yakuza 0_ is a prequel to the Yakuza series as a whole, hence the "0" in the name. You play as _Kiryu Kazuma_, the mainstay character of the series and also _Majima Goro_, who I can best describe as Kiryu's rival, both in a friendly and not-so-friendly way, so essentially a _frenemy_.

## Backstories

### Kiryu Kazuma

  <center>
    <figcaption>Kiryu Kazuma</figcaption>
  </center>{" "}
</figure>

Kiryu is a serious, no-nonsense type of guy, but also very oblivious in certain areas (women for example), but he's a good man at heart who really does not seem like a bad Yakuza. You'd imagine him starting his his own animal shelter, or an orphanage, but surprise surprise, he is a Yakuza. He was raised as an orphan, and his father figure was a Yakuza, hence his current occupation.

### Goro Majima

<figure>
  {" "}
  <img src="/yakuza-0/majima-goro.jpg" alt="Goro Majima" />{" "}
  <center>
    <figcaption>Goro Majima</figcaption>
  </center>{" "}
</figure>

As for Majima, there's nothing much mentioned about his childhood in this game, but we know that he is working as the manager of a Cabaret Club called the Grand. The reason for this is that he made a _big oopsie_ (major plot point in another game) that basically ended up with his left eye becoming a glorified marshmellow on a skewer (ouch), and he was expelled from the Tojo clan as a result. You may think he wants to be there by choice, but this is not the case. In reality he really wants to get back in the yakuza business again (just why), and to go back, he has to make _500 million yen_ somehow and give it to them. This drives him to take on various sorts of endeavours in order to make the money.

## The Setting

This game is set in the good old '80s, where life was good, the economy was booming, and everyone was richer (atleast compared to today) thanks to the Japanese asset price bubble, which was an economic bubble in Japan from 1986 to 1991 in which real estate and stock market prices were greatly inflated. It did pop in 1991 which made everyone not-so-rich or happy anymore but we don't talk about that (The Lost Decades). To be specific this game is set in the year 1988.

### Kamurocho

Now, our story starts off with kiryu in this grand, grand city of _Kamurocho_, the city that never sleeps. The thing is that Kamurocho is actually inspired from a real-life city by the name of _Kabukicho_, which is very cool. It is quite a faithful remake of the city, with some proportions altered to fit the game, but nonetheless the attention to detail is so good that if I were in Kabukicho, I could navigate it without needing a map.

### Sotenbori

The other prominent location is _Sotenbori_, which is more like a town that never sleeps. You might have already guessed it, but Sotenbori is also inspired from a real-life city which goes by the name, _Dotonbori_. The river of Dotonbori is quite iconic, and makes an appearance in the game as part of the playable area.

## The Basic Plot

Moving on, I could go on and explain the full plot but then this'll be _way too long_ and _convoluted_, so I am gonna keep it **_EXTREMELY_** brief now.

### The Plot - Kiryu Kazuma

A young yakuza member in Tokyo, Kiryu is framed for a murder he didn‚Äôt commit. To clear his name and protect his adopted father, he leaves the Dojima Family and seeks to uncover the truth behind a real estate dispute over a plot of land known as the "Empty Lot."

  </center>{" "}
</figure>

### The Plot - Goro Majima

In Osaka, Majima runs a cabaret club while being exiled from the yakuza. He is given a chance to rejoin the yakuza (as you already know), by gathering a sum of 500,000,000 Yen. Later on in his story, he is given a mission that will get him in instantly, provided he completes it. This mission is an assassination mission. However, upon discovering the target is a defenseless blind woman, Makoto, he defies orders and becomes entangled in protecting her and uncovering a larger conspiracy.

    <figcaption>Majima protects Makoto</figcaption>
  </center>{" "}
</figure>

### The Plot - Pacing and Intertwined Destinies

This game is structured in such a way that there are 17 chapters/acts to play through. Both characters get 2 chapters each before switching to the other character, starting off with Kiryu. The final chapter is a finale where you play as both.

The thing I really like about this game is that they managed to master the cliffhangers at the end of the 2 chapters that each character has. This leaves the player with so many questions, and also when we return to that character a couple chapters later, the questions are answered, but new questions pop up. While one plotline may get stale, the other does its job to keep the player engaged to the story as a whole. This is done so perfectly with the twists and the cliffhangers that I feel like this deserves a Pulitzer Prize for it.

One example is when Majima meets Makoto, at first he decides to protect her, on seeing that she's a blind, defenseless woman. But later on, as the temptation of getting into back into the Yakuza life seems to overcome him, we get this scene at the end his two-chapter arc:

  />{" "}
  <center>
    <figcaption>Majima nearly decides to kill Makoto</figcaption>
  </center>{" "}
</figure>

Throughout the game, both Kiryu and Majima navigate the criminal underworld, engage in intense combat, and participate in various side activities that reflect 1980s Japan‚Äôs vibrant nightlife. Their stories intertwine, revealing deeper connections to the power struggles within the yakuza and the significance of the Empty Lot.

The intertwined nature of this game's dual, converging plotline is also wonderfully executed. Events in Kiryu's life have effects on Majima's, despite their distance. The best part is that they never meet each other throughout the game, despite both being major causes for change in each others' lives.

## The Characters

The side characters are absolutely fantastic in Yakuza 0. You've got these three for example: _Daisaku Kuze_, _Hiroshi Awano_, and _Keiji Shibusawa_, who are three out of the five lieutenants of the Dojima Family, a powerful yakuza organization in Kamurocho. Each lieutenant controls their own sub-family and plays a significant role in the game‚Äôs narrative. Aside from that, many of the prominent side characters have been modelled after their voice actors. In the picture given below, the characters and their corresponding voice actors are shown side-by-side:

</figure>

### Daisaku Kuze

Daisaku Kuze is a tough, no-nonsense enforcer known for his brutal fighting style and relentless pursuit of his goals. He represents the muscle of the Dojima Family and is driven by a strong sense of pride. The voice acting of Kuze is very on point, and he sounds *just* the way you'd expect him to.
